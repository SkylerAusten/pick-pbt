The Rules

    The Deck: Instead of suits and ranks, we use 5 tiers of emojis.

        Legendary (Value 5): 🐉, 🦄, 👽, 👾

        Epic (Value 4): 🦁, 🐯, 🐻, 🦈

        Rare (Value 3): 🍕, 🍔, 🌮, 🍣

        Uncommon (Value 2): 🌵, 🍄, 🌻, 🌲

        Common (Value 1): 🧦, 📎, 🧱, 🧻

    Gameplay:

        The deck is shuffled and split evenly between Player A and Player B.

        In each round, both players reveal their top card.

        The player with the higher value card wins the round and collects both cards (adding them to the bottom of their deck).

        War: If there is a tie, a battle occurs. Both players put one card face down and one card face up. The higher face-up card wins all cards involved.

    Winning: The game ends when one player runs out of cards or a turn limit is reached.
